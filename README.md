# Divorce-Prediction
For this class assignment, my teammates and I were tasked with predicting whether a couple would divorce using a number of supervised machine learning algorithms.

For this project, we decided on Option I: Divorce Classification. Each team performing this task was asked to build three classifiers using test data, so we could predict whether a sample should be labeled as divorced or not divorced. In addition to these three classifiers, we decided to use three additional classifiers to complete this task, and then use all six underlying methods to create classifiers using the first two features of the 170 samples. 
We chose this project option because it seemed like a straightforward task to apply the techniques and models that we learned in class.

Methods
	The methods for our first classifiers were the 3 required: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a standard neural network. For our 3 additional models, we chose K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA), and Random Forest (RF)
